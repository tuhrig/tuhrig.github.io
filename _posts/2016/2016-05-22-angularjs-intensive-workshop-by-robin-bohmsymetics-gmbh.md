Last week I attended an [AngularJS Intensive Workshop](https://angularjs.de/veranstaltungen/angularjs-workshop-mai-2016) by [Robin Böhm](https://twitter.com/RobinBoehm) from [Symetics GmbH](http://symetics.com). 
Symetics is the company behind [www.angularjs.de](http://www.angularjs.de) and provides consulting and training all around JavaScript, AngularJS (1/2) and TypeScript.

## The location

The 3-days workshop was located in the [UNPERFEKT Haus](http://www.unperfekthaus.de) in [Essen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essen). 
The UNPERFEKT Haus is an open space for artists, students and musicians. 
It provides rooms, WLAN and a creative environment. 
It was a great location for the seminar and we all felt comfortable.

## The trainer

Our trainer was [Robin Böhm](https://twitter.com/RobinBoehm) who is the CEO/founder of Symetics GmbH. 
He works as a freelancer and does consulting, in-house training and workshops all around web technologies like AngularJS. 
During the 3-days he provided a lot of information and made a really intense workshop. 
The atmosphere was relaxed and Robin was open for discussions and questions - even during the lunch break.

## The workshop

The workshop was divided into two parts: 
(1) a round trip about JavaScript and (2) a dive-deep on AngularJS. 
It was a good mix of presentations and hands-on sessions on a prepared sample project. 
Robin managed to cover a huge amount of topics:

- components vs. directives
- routing (with the new router from AngularJS 1.5)
- testing (with Jasmine)
- the promise API
- build tools
- books to continue
- ...

Robin also tried to give us an outlook on AngularJS 2 and how we can prepare our current projects for it.

## My opinion

There wasn't much I did not like. 
The workshop covered all relevant topics and gave us a lot of useful insights into AngularJS and related stuff.

**I can recommend it!**

It was fast, well-prepared and very practical (we wrote code for about 1/3 of the time). 
The group was medium-sized, maybe 14 people (mostly Java developers). 
The only downside was that Robin sometimes provided too much detail on a particular topic. 
I'm more comfortable staying by the underlying concepts of a technology and dive into the nitty-gritty details when I'm working on it.

I'm looking forward to the next workshop! Thanks!
