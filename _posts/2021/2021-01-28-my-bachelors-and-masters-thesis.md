In 2011 I wrote my Bachelor's Thesis and about three years later in 2014 it was time for Master's Thesis. 
I blogged a lot about both projects back then, but I never published the actual documents. 
The reason for that was that I wrote both thesis in cooperation with a company. My Bachelor's Thesis has been a research project for [IBM](https://www.ibm.com)'s database development team (DB2 on z/OS) and my Master's Thesis has been written for [Informatica](https://www.informatica.com) and their PIM team. So both documents have been under a blocking notice for a certain period of time. I wasn't allowed to publish them.

However, the blocking period has expired for some time and so I thought it's time to upload them. 
I'm very proud of both thesis and I hope that they are of interest for someone else.

(Both documents are in _German_)
