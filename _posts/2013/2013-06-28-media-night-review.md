Raphael Brand, Hannes Pernpeintner and I presented our semester project yesterday on the Media Night at our university. It was very nice to met some interested people, to answer their questions and to show what we did during the last four months. Thanks.

Here are some impressions of last night. Our project is still online on [http://techtrends.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/](http://techtrends.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/). We will run it as long as we can.
