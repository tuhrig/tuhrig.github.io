During the last four weeks I did another small project for one of my university courses this semester. The course was about ORM modelling and abstractions for databases. We did some exercies with Hibernate and discussed diefferent aspects about ORM modelling. At the end of the course, every student made a small web-project using a framework and ORM tool of his choice.

Most of us used [Play!](http://www.playframework.com/ "Play!") and [ebeans](http://www.avaje.org/ "ebeans") to make their application - me too. I didn't have any experience with Play! but it was very pleasent to work with. Togehter with [Foundation CSS](http://foundation.zurb.com/ "Foundation CSS") prototyping was extremly fast. And ebeans also did a great job. During the whole project I didn't write any line of SQL - nice!
