I spend the last few weeks in **Aix-en-Provence**, a small town in the very south of France close to Marseille. My girlfriend is currently studying there as a part of her master-degree. Since the weather is not so bad there (especially compared to Germany and Sweden), I got the chance to shot some good photos. Enjoy.
