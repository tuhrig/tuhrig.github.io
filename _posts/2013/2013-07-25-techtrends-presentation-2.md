Tomorrow morning is the final presentation of our semester project [TechTrends](http://techtrends.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/ "TechTrends"). I posted several articles about TechTrends (see [here](http://tuhrig.de/tag/techtrends/ "TechTrends Posts")) and I will definetely post one more after tomorrow. But for now, here's our final presentation.

The presentation shows how we built TechTrends and covers different aspects of the development process. It talks about crawling [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/ "Hackernews") and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/ "Reddit"), preprocessing and learning a model to query. We also describe problems, further ideas and many more. The presentation will take about 60 to 70 minutes (and everybody is still welcome tomorrow).

The presentation will also be streamed live on [http://events.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de](http://events.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de).

**Best regards,** Thomas Uhrig
