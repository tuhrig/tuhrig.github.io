Optimizing the images of a web page is easy and the best way to speedup the site. On the basis of the famous book "[Even Faster Web Sites](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596522304?tag=stevsoud-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=0596522304&adid=09TZDJ7Z5GDMJPAM6XC6&)" by [Steve Souders](http://www.stevesouders.com/), Annette Landmesser and I made a small presentation for an university course called [Development of Rich Media Systems](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/vorlesung_detail?vorlid=4800544) thought by [Jakob Schr√∂ter](http://www.xing.com/profile/Jakob_Schroeter). The presentation contains some general patterns and practices for lossy and non-lossy optimization. Enjoy.

I will also write a paper about image optimization for websites for my university course in a couple of weeks. The paper will be in German.
