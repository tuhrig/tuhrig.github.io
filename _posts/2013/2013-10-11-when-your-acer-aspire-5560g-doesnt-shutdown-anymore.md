Last year I bought an **Acer Aspire 5560G** as my second laptop (yes, sometimes two are better than one). A half year later, I was working pretty much with this laptop and decided to upgrade it with a SSD drive. So I bought a brand new **Samsung SSD 840 PRO** with 256 GB. I was very happy. Well, was...

After installing the SSD and reinstalling Windows 7 there was something strange - Windows didn't shutdown anymore. Whenever I tried to shutdown my laptop (or restart it or put it to hibernate) Windows went off, but the laptop was still on. The ventilator was running, power was on and the lights at the front of my laptop were blinking. So what?

So I tried to fix it. I reinstalled Windows (both, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1). I installed all kind of driver, even of devices I don't have. I updated, I formated, I read the internet and so on. I even flashed my BIOS to be sure. But nothing worked for me.

Last night I was searching the web again and I was very despaired. I found [a forum post](http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?102746-Aspire-5560G-won-t-power-down-with-Agility-3-120GB) of some guy who had the same problem. And his solution was pretty simple: he installed Windows using an USB driver rather than a DVD. I thought what the fuck, he's joking, forget about it. But as I woke up this morning I was still despraid and I thought, well, let's try it. I mean, why not?

So I put my Windows 7 DVD into my drive and copied it to an USB drive using some dubios freeware software that tried to install one browser-toolbar after another. But ten minutes later I had my Windows copy on my bootable USB stick. Restart, format, install, waiting... During the installation the laptop restarted several times and I assumed that this is a good sign.

After aproximately 30 minutes the big moment came and I pressed on "shutdown" in my brand new Windows 7 installation. Aaaannnddd baaammm it went off!

I studied 11 semesters of computer science right now. I installed all kinds of Windows (98, XP, Vista, 7, 8), some Linux distributions and other stuff. But that there is a difference between installing Windows from a DVD or from an USB stick doesn't make any f\*\*\*ing sense to me. Thank you Microsoft.
