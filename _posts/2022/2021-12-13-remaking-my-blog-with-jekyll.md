I started blogging in May 2011 - more than 10 years ago!
Back then, I had no experience with blogging, but I was interested in writing and creating content.
So I gave it a try, bought a yearly subscription for webspace and began to build my blog.

Right from the beginning, I made an obvious decision: 
I installed Wordpress together with a couple of plugins and themes to get started.
And to get things clear, Worpress did a great job for more than a decade for me!

## Why I want to migrate away from Wordpress

However, since a couple of years, I have the feeling that Wordpress is growing over my head.
I must take care of installing updates, moderating comments, optimize the performance and manage a bunch of plugins which I think I need.
And in the end, it comes all down to this:
**Wordpress is far too powerful for the simple tasks I want to achieve.**

## What's the alternative?

As obvious as Wordpress was back in 2011 for me, so is GitHub pages right now.
I'm a software developer and working with Git and Markdown is easy for me.
The concept of generating static HTML based on templates feels like a light-weight alternative for a full-fledged CMS like Wordpress.
Exactly what I want!

## Migrating from Wordpress to GitHub Pages (Jekyll)

### 1 Exporting all of my posts from Wordpress

### 2 Choosing a theme and cloning the repo

### 3 Manually edit the old exported posts

### 4 Switching the domain
