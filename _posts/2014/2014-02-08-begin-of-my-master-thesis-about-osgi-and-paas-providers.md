My studies go into the final round - since the first of February I work on my master thesis about (enterprise) OSGi applications and PaaS providers in the cloud. I evaluate an existing OSGi server application and try to migrate it to a PaaS provider. My deadline is in the mid of July 2014.

Right now I am doing my literature studies and try to get an overview about the topic. I don't know the exact direction of my thesis yet, but I can figure out some problems along the road like databases, scalability, dependencies and deployment. And I think some more will show up soon.

I write my thesis by [Informatica](http://www.informatica.com)/[Heiler](http://www.heiler.com) in Stuttgart. I will blog about it from time to time under [/tag/cloud](/tag/cloud).

**Best regards,** Thomas
