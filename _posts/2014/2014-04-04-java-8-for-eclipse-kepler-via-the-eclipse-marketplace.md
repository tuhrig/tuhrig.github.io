Eclipse Foundation Announces Java 8 Support! One day after [my post](http://tuhrig.de/java-8-in-eclipse-kepler-and-luna/) about Java 8 in Eclipse Kepler (4.3) and Eclipse Luna (4.4), the Eclipse Foundation announced official support for Java 8 in Eclipse Kepler. Here is there blog post straight outta Ottawa, Canada:

You can now install Java 8 support to Eclipse Kepler (4.3) via the Eclipse Marketplace:

A little bit late (!), but finally the easiest way to use Java 8 in Eclipse.

**Best regards,** Thomas
