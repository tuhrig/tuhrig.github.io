This year there is something new on the [Media Night](http://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/medianight), the student fair at our university.

# The booklet is dead!

In its past, the Media Night had had a printed booklet with its program and time table in it. The booklet was produced by one of our printing faculties for which the HdM is pretty famous. It was distributed for free during the evening of the fair.

# Long live the booklet!

However, since this semester the good old booklet is history! Instead of it, the Media Night has a brand new app with all projects, students and even an indoor navigation. You can find it in [Apple's App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/medianight/id781426390?mt=8) and [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hdm.medianightapp&hl=de).

# Most innovative projects

But why only have one app if you could have two? In case you have an Apple iPad or iPhone you can get an app about the 10 most innovative projects of this Media Night. And - TechTrends is one of it!

I hope you enjoy the apps, the projects and the evening.

**Best regards from the Media Night**, Thomas
