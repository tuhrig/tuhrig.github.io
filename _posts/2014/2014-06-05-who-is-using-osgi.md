Who is using OSGi? If you take a look [http://www.osgi.org/About/Members](http://www.osgi.org/About/Members) you will see more than a hundred members of the the [OSGi Alliance](http://www.osgi.org) and a lot of big players just like [IBM](http://www.ibm.com) or [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com). But lets do a little investigation with [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends) on our own.

# Google Trends

[Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends) is a service where you can search for a particular key word and get a time line. The time line shows you when the key word was search and how many requests have been made. That is a great way to estimate how popular a certain technology is at a time. Google will also show you where the search requests have been made - and that is where we start.

# OSGi in Google Trends

If we search for "_OSGi_" on Google Trends we will see a chart just like the one shown below. As we can see, OSGi is somehow over its peak and the interest in the technology is decreasing since a couple of years.

But even more interesting is the map which shows where the search requests have been made. As we can see, most requests came from China. On the fourth place is Germany.

If we take a closer look on Germany, we see that most requests come from the south of Germany.

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.de/trends/embed.js?hl=en&amp;geo=DE&amp;q=osgi&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=GEO_MAP_0_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=600&amp;h=530"></script>

But we can even get more specific and view the exact cities. It is a little bit hard to see in the chart, but you can click on the link at the bottom to see the [full report](http://www.google.de/trends/explore?hl=de#geo=DE-BW&q=osgi&cmpt=q). You will see **Walldorf**, **Karlsruhe** and **Stuttgart** on top. So what? Well, in Walldorf, there is one big player who is not on the list of the OSGi Alliance: **SAP**.

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.de/trends/embed.js?hl=en&amp;geo=DE-BW&amp;q=osgi&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=GEO_MAP_0_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=600&amp;h=530"></script>

We can do the very same with the USA and we will end up in California and Redwood City, where companies like **Oracle** and **Informatica** are located.

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.de/trends/embed.js?hl=en&amp;geo=US-CA&amp;q=osgi&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=GEO_MAP_0_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=600&amp;h=530"></script>

**Best regards,** Thomas
