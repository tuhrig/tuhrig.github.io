One thing first: The book _Cloud Computing: Chancen und Risiken aus technischer und unternehmerischer Sicht_ by Christian Metzger, Thorsten Reitz and Juan Villar is only available in German! I am sorry.

As a part of my literature studies for my master thesis I recently read [Cloud Computing: Chancen und Risiken aus technischer und unternehmerischer Sicht](http://www.amazon.de/Cloud-Computing-Chancen-technischer-unternehmerischer/dp/3446424547) by Christian Metzger, Thorsten Reitz and Juan Villar published by [Hanser](http://www.hanser.de) in 2011. Here is what I think about it.

# A lot of different aspects

The book gives you an overview about a lot of different aspects on the topic of cloud computing. It really covers a lot: definitions, pros and cons, security, business aspects, vendors and some more. All aspects are described briefly but with enough information to get an understanding for what the topic is about. However, the book will only give you an overview. If you are interested in a certain topic (e.g. security) this book can only be a first hint, not more.

# Who should read this book?

I really liked the book, but the question is who should read it? It is not technical enough for a developer and does not cover enough business aspects for a manager (I think). I think it is most suitable for someone wondering what cloud is and thinking about whether he could use it or not. You do not need knowledge in a certain field to understand the book. It is a good start to get in touch with cloud computing, but nothing more.

**Best regards,** Thomas
