The last months have been an interesting and busy time for me (that's why I didn't write as much as I had planed, but I already got some new drafts in my Wordpress!). After I finished my master's thesis at [Informatica](http://www.informatica.com) in Stuttgart (greetings to the whole team!), I moved to Berlin for my first "real" job. I started at a company called [Westernacher Products and Services](http://www.westernacher.com), which does a lot of web applications and consulting for juristic institutions in Germany. Based on an up-to-date technology stack with Spring, Gradle, ExtJS and AngularJS, Westernacher implements document management and all kinds of business applications. Being part of the development team I am looking forward to a bunch of interesting projects and to a lot of new stuff to learn. Nice to be here!

**Best regards,** Thomas
