After almost 5 months [Linköping University](http://www.liu.se/?l=en) in Sweden, it's time for me to leave and go home again. The tickets for the ferry are already booked as well as a cheap hostel in the middle of Hamburg - I think this stop will be fun.

Here are some last pictures from Lappland, Västerås and Linköping itself. Enjoy, I did it.
