Last Monday, I arrived in Linköping, Sweden. Until December, I will do my ERASMUS semester here. I'm at the [Linköping University](http://www.liu.se/?l=en), where I will take some courses of the [Computer Science Master Program](http://www.liu.se/en/education/master/programmes/6MICS?l=en). The orientation program is starting today (in about an hour) and the actual courses will start next Monday.

Together with my girlfriend, I traveled to Sweden in the last couple of weeks. Here are some of our impressions. The pictures have no special order. They are from Germany (Düsseldrof, Münster and Rostock), Denmark (especially from Copenhagen) and Sweden.

I will not blog about every little happening, but you will probably find some of the "big news" or "great pictures" here.
