I have currently finished a presentation about XForms and how you can use XForms to create multimodal applications (according to a [paper](http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2007/isbn9789512285662/article9.pdf "paper") of **Mikko Honkala** and **Mikko Pohja**). Here is the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/pub?id=11cRrVVdNHVmBSsI5TDZefUldR2gfeaqMhVYbVXbbWwk&start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000 "Google Doc") and here is the [PDF file](http://tuhrig.de/wp-content/uploads/Presentation.pdf).

I will post my own paper about the topic in a couple of days (or at the end of the term if I'm lazy...).

**Best regards,** Thomas Uhrig.
