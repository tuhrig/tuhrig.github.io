My name is Thomas and I'm a software developer based near [Karlsruhe](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe), Germany. 
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is my weapon of choice, whether with [Java](https://www.java.com/) or [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
I love to build microservices and to write code which is easy to read.
Currently, I work for [Atruvia](https://atruvia.de/) in Karlsruhe and from my home office.

I studied [Computer Science and Media](http://www.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/csm) at the [Media University (HdM)](http://www.hdm-stuttgart.de "HdM Stuttgart") in [Stuttgart](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stuttgart,+Deutschland), Germany, where I finished my Bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Science, [ðŸ“„](/assets/pdf/Bachelor-Thesis.pdf)) in 2012 and my Master's degree (Master of Science, [ðŸ“„](/assets/pdf/Master-Thesis.pdf)) in 2014.

I worked for [Bringmeister](/bye-bye-bringmeister) until its closure in 2024 as a backend Kotlin developer. 
Before that, I served as a fullstack software developer for [Westernacher Solutions](http://westernacher-solutions.com) in [Berlin](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) and joined [Informatica](http://www.informatica.com/ "Informatica") (formerly [Heiler](http://www.heiler.com/de//index.php "Heiler Software AG")) and [IBM](http://www-05.ibm.com/de/entwicklung/ "IBM BÃ¶blingen") as an intern, student worker and graduate.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing [BJJ](https://www.psv-karlsruhe.de/brazilian-jiu-jitsu) at PSV Karlsruhe.

You find me on [XING](https://www.xing.com/profiles/Thomas_Uhrig7) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-uhrig/85/6bb/39).
