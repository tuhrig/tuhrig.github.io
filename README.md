## What is this?

This right here is my personal blog.
I use this blog to write about software development and related topics.
Back in the days, this blog was hosted by a Wordpress instance.
It was migrated to Jakyll / githup.io in December 2022.

## Run me locally

    gem install jekyll bundler
    bundle init
 
    # Install the used gems
    bundle

    # Run Jekyll to see the blog
    bundle exec jekyll serve
